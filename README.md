<h2>Why Poem Spot?</h2>

Our application, Poem Spot, is a central hub for reading, posting, and searching for POEMS and viewing LOCAL EVENTS.

Users upload writing to their personal page, and users can view each other’s writing. This helps people in the writing community to keep abreast of their peers’ work. 

Our home page lists local events, including author readings, open mics, and more. This news feed is specific to the interests of writers. 

Poem Spot is narrowly focused and free of distracting content. 

In short, it’s a community space for people who share an interest in the written word.
